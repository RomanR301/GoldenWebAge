          <h2>What is search engine optimization anyway?</h2>
          <p>The position of your own page in the search engines is directly linked to the value of a page. If the
            website is well placed, it will attract more customers. This ensures more sales and thus greater success for
            business on the Internet. However, the competition is fierce and Google in particular places high demands on
            those sites that want to land at the top of the search results. Search Engine Optimization, or SEO for
            short, are various tools and measures that are intended to help ensure that your own page is better listed
            on Google. These measures on your own page make it more interesting for Google and significantly more
            present in the relevant keywords.</p>

          <h2>Why is the position in the search engines important?</h2>
          <p>Of course, we not only advise you on the best solution, but also implement it directly in your application.
            From simple shared hosting to dedicated, horizontally scaling applications, we have already deployed
            everything. We use Uberspace or 1und1 hosting for small applications. For large solutions, mostly AWS
            (Amazon Web Service) or, more rarely, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud is used. For larger applications that
            can automatically scale horizontally, we rely on Docker to provide the same services with significantly
            fewer resources.</p>
