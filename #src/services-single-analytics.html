          <p>Google Analytics is one of the most powerful tools nowadays, which shows you exactly how the visitors of
            your website behave. And the best for you: Google also offers most of its services for free. Complex setups
            such as multi-domains, own development and test environments, different countries, shops and ecommerce
            websites can also be evaluated - the problem here is much more the how than the whether. Learn more about
            Google Analytics 4 here</p>

          <p>Matomo is an open source-based solution for your individual web analytics - we often use it as an
            alternative to Google Analytics. The user interface is also very clear, which is why it is possible to work
            quickly and in a structured manner with the software and to query various parameters.
            We develop our recommendations for action based on the data obtained by Matomo, tailored precisely to the
            customer.</p>
          <p>A big advantage of Matomo is that the data is on your own server - if only for reasons of data protection.
            You can also take your analytics to an even higher level at any time.</p>
